# ⚙️ VS Code Profiles – Fullstack Edition

> “Your editor should think like you — whether you’re designing the UI or architecting the API.”

---

### 🧭 Why This Exists

Most developers use a single VS Code setup for everything — frontend, backend, and fullstack.
But different layers of a system demand **different modes of thinking** and **different editor behaviors**.

This collection of profiles separates those worlds while keeping them **seamlessly unified**.
Each profile is handcrafted to match real production workflows — minimal, intelligent, and consistent.

- 🧠 **Frontend** — Creativity and flow for React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.
- ⚙️ **Backend** — Logic and structure for NestJS, PostgreSQL, and REST APIs.
- 🌍 **Fullstack** — Unified control for developers who move across both effortlessly.

### 🧩 Folder Structure

```

### 🛠 How It Works

Each profile defines:
- **Custom editor settings** for that environment
- **Recommended extensions** for performance and accuracy
- **Prettier + ESLint alignment** for consistent formatting
- **IntelliSense tuning** for smoother autocompletion
- **Minimal UI** for focus and clarity

Switch instantly between contexts:
1. Open VS Code → ⚙️ → **Profiles** → *Import Profile from File System*
2. Choose `frontend`, `backend`, or `fullstack` based on your work
3. Restart VS Code (optional but recommended)

No reconfiguration. No broken extensions. Just plug and play.

### 💡 What You Get

✅ Unified Prettier + ESLint setup across all profiles
✅ Lightweight and lag-free environment
✅ Seamless navigation between frontend and backend code
✅ Developer flow optimized for *production-grade projects*
✅ Clean diffs, consistent commits, and minimal distractions

---

### 🪄 Philosophy

> “Code faster by thinking less about configuration.”

This is not just about themes or fonts — it’s about **mental clarity**.
When your environment adapts to your context, you stay in flow longer, build cleaner, and debug faster.

Whether you’re designing a React UI or deploying a NestJS API — your editor should evolve with you.
